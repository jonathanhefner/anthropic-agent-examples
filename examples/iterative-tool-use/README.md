# Iterative Tool Use

This example demonstrates support for iterative tool use, where the agent can make multiple tool calls before providing a final response to the user.

This example also provides an implementation for [Claude's built-in text editor tool](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool).
